Crop the photo.
There are three types of cropping: ```Circle```, ```Rounded rectangle```, and ```iOS icon style```.

# Recommendation
Square images are recommended.
There is no problem with "Rounded Rectangle".

However, in "Circle", the center of the photo is cropped to become a circle, and in "iOS", only the radius of the rounded corners looks like iOS.
